# Palefire

Drupal 11 theme (starterkit-generated) built on Bootstrap 5.3 + Dart Sass.

## Build

    npm install        # bootstrap, bootstrap-icons, swup, sass
    npm run build      # scss/style.scss -> css/style.css, copies Bootstrap JS, Swup + icons
    npm run watch      # recompile on save

## Structure

- `palefire.info.yml` – regions, global libraries, `core_version_requirement: ^11`
- `palefire.breakpoints.yml` – Bootstrap 5 breakpoints (sm 576 / md 768 / lg 992 / xl 1200 / xxl 1400)
- `scss/` – `_variables.scss` (brand + Bootstrap overrides), `base/`, `layout/`, `components/`
- `components/toc/` – Single Directory Component: "On this page" navigation
- `src/Hook/PalefireHooks.php` – OOP theme hooks (TOC, section anchors, branding)
- `templates/paragraphs/` – section markup for Modular pages
- `scripts/palefire_modular_setup.php` – one-time Paragraphs/field setup (drush php:script)

## Modular pages

Any paragraph type with `field_section_title` placed in `field_sections` on a
`modular_page` node becomes a `<section>` with an H2, a stable anchor, and a TOC
entry. `field_full_page` turns on full-viewport scroll-snap (md and up).

### Building maps

A bento section can show a building floor map under its search form
(`bento_search.field_bento_map` -> `building_map` paragraph). Rooms show a
tooltip on hover or focus. The "Legend & spaces" list puts Floor 1 first, and
the background video dims and blurs while the map is in view. "Search LSU
Libraries" and the map heading are h3s so the TOC lists them.

Each building is one drawing plus an entry in `maps/buildings.yml` (label,
default heading, Twig include, rooms with floor). The content lives in the
**Building spaces** taxonomy: one term per building (its description is the
default intro) with a child term per room (tooltip text, access, optional
link). Unpublish a room term to draw it as plain floor. Editors add a
**Building map** to the bento and pick the building; nothing else is needed.
**Room overrides (optional)** on the paragraph change one room's tooltip,
access or link on that page only. It stays collapsed to an "Add Room
override" button until used.

```bash
npm run build      # compiles _building-map.scss into css/style.css; commit it
drush php:script themes/custom/palefire/scripts/palefire_building_map_setup.php
drush cr
```

The setup script creates the vocabulary, paragraph types and fields, and
creates any building/room terms missing from Building spaces (it never
overwrites existing terms, so editors own the text). Re-run it after editing
`buildings.yml`. To add a building: add its drawing under
`templates/includes/`, add an entry to `buildings.yml`, and re-run.

Upgrading from the per-page "Map space" version: the old `map_space` type
and `building_map.field_map_spaces` are listed but kept. Run the script with
`-- cleanup` to delete them. The bento's map is now rendered by
`palefire_preprocess_paragraph__bento_search()`, so it no longer depends on
the bento's view display.

### Full-page backgrounds and frosted glass

Section background images (`field_section_bg`) and bento background videos
run past their section to fill the page: left under the "On this page"
sidebar (lg and up) and, for the first section, up under the top bar. The top
bar and the sidebar are frosted glass (translucent + `backdrop-filter`), so
the background shows through, blurred. Only the decorative layer moves;
section content and solid section colours stay in the main column.

- Tune the glass in `scss/_variables.scss`: `$pf-glass-blur`,
  `$pf-glass-saturate`, `$pf-header-bg-alpha`. The sidebar wash is
  `sidebar-bg` in `scss/components/_modular-tokens.scss`.
- `js/palefire.js` (`palefireBleedOffset`) measures how far the first
  background has to reach up, so a breadcrumb, title or tabs above the
  sections are covered too. Those stay on top of the image.
- Users with `prefers-reduced-transparency` or `prefers-contrast: more` get
  a solid top bar and sidebar. Browsers without `backdrop-filter` get a
  nearly opaque top bar.

## Page transitions (Swup 4)

`js/palefire-swup.js` swaps `#swup` (breadcrumb + body) and `#pf-primary-menu`
for anonymous visitors, re-running Drupal behaviors and syncing drupalSettings,
meta tags, and body classes. Pages that need new assets or contain inline
scripts fall back to a full load. Opt out per link with `data-no-swup`.
